If you are using XeTeX or luaTeX, you do not need the files in this
directory.

The stix2 package provides support for versions of TeX that are
limited to TFM files, Type 1 PostScript fonts, and 8-bit font
encodings.  Version 2.0.0 of the STIX fonts are being released in this
format in hopes of easing the transition from legacy TeX engines to
modern fully Unicode-compatible systems.  The Type 1 versions are
merely a repackaging of the original OpenType versions and should not
be viewed as independent entities.  Some glyphs that are traditionally
available in TeX math fonts are not yet available in the STIX Two
OpenType fonts.  In such cases, we have chosen to omit them from the
stix2 package rather than create incompatibilities between the
OpenType and Type 1 versions.  In addition, while development of the
OpenType versions is ongoing, no further updates are planned to the
Type 1 versions of the fonts.

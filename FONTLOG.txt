Basic Font Information
----------------------

INTRODUCTION

The Scientific and Technical Information eXchange (STIX) fonts are
intended to satisfy the demanding needs of authors, publishers,
printers, and others working in the scientific, medical, and technical
fields.  They combine a comprehensive Unicode-based collection of
mathematical symbols and alphabets with a set of text faces suitable
for professional publishing.  The fonts are available royalty-free
under the SIL Open Font License.

Version 2.0.0 of the STIX fonts, now known as "STIX Two", is a
thorough revision undertaken by the renowned type house Tiro Typeworks
Ltd. (https://www.tiro.com).  The STIX Two fonts consist of one Math
font, two variable text fonts (STIXTwoTextVF-Roman and
STIXTwoTextVF-Italic), and eight static text fonts (Regular, Italic,
Medium, Medium Italic, SemiBold, SemiBold Italic, Bold, and Bold
Italic) derived from the variable fonts.  Together, they provide a
uniform set of fonts that can be used throughout the production
process, whether that be a traditional print-only process, an entirely
electronic one, or a combination of the two.

The STIX project began through the joint efforts of American
Mathematical Society (AMS), American Institute of Physics (AIP),
American Physical Society (APS), American Chemical Society (ACS), The
Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), and Elsevier.
These companies are collectively known as the STI Pub companies.

A FRESH TAKE ON TIMES ROMAN

The original version of STIX was based on Times Roman, which has now
been updated for the digital age.

As is well known, Times Roman was originally intended for printing the
London Times.  What is not generally appreciated is that the
production quality of the *Times* was atypically high: It was printed
on unusually high-quality paper on presses that operated more slowly
than most newspaper presses.  This allowed for the design of a
typeface that could exploit this level of care: serifs could be much
finer and counters (enclosed areas such as that in the lowercase e)
could be much smaller than in other newspaper typefaces.  These
features of the font have not always fared well in less exacting
environments.  At the same time, a notable quirk of the Times Roman
family is that the bold font is, in many respects, strikingly
dissimilar to the roman font.

Tiro Typeworks explain their approach to updating the Times Roman
basis of STIX as follows:

    "Our principal goal in approaching STIX Two was to address several
    inherent deficiencies in the Times New Roman model as well as
    expand the typographic features.  This process necessarily
    involved diverging somewhat from Times, given that many features
    of that typeface are either incompatible with current printing
    methods and electronic reading environments, and some others too
    esoteric to repeat.  That said, the essential 'Times-ness'
    remains, we believe, and such changes won't distract readers and
    users in any negative way.

    "At the core of Times' problems was inappropriate digitization,
    using an optical size model too large to be scaled down to text
    sizes, with compensations appropriate to its original purpose and
    printing technique, but not for 21st century conditions.  We have
    also re-thought somewhat overall proportions and spacing, with
    changes made in varying degrees to both the Roman and the Italic
    (and we have begun to harmonize the Bold, which has always been a
    major shortcoming with Times New Roman)."

-----------------------------------

13 January 2021, STIX Two, version 2.11

* Changed "Semibold" to "SemiBold" in all font and file names.

* Fixed various technical issues required for compatibility with the
  Google Fonts platform.  There were no changes to font metrics or
  glyph shapes.

-----------------------------------

18 December 2020, STIX Two, version 2.10

For compatibility with the internal major/minor versioning convention
used by the OpenType font format, the public version number was
switched from the three-part semantic versioning convention to a
two-part number.

All non-variable fonts are now available in both OTF and TTF formats.

The WOFF format is no longer distributed.

COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN 2.0.2 AND 2.10

There have been extensive changes to both glyph shapes and font
metrics in this release.  These could affect the layout of documents
prepared with previous versions of these fonts.

UPDATES TO MATH AND TEXT FONTS

The following changes apply to both the text and math fonts:

* Removed the Macintosh platform entries from the name table as they
  are now considered obsolete.

UPDATES TO TEXT FONTS

* 2.10 includes OpenType variable font builds for the Text fonts
  (STIXTwoTextVF-Roman.ttf and STIXTwoTextVF-Italic.ttf). For more
  information about variable fonts see:

      https://medium.com/variable-fonts/https-medium-com-tiro-introducing-opentype-variable-fonts-12ba6cd2369

  The STIX Two Text variable fonts support a weight interpolation axis
  between the regular and bold weights, with named instances for
  medium and semibold.  New static fonts for these instances are
  derived from the variable fonts.  Development of the variable fonts
  was funded by Google Fonts.

* New static weights: Medium and Semibold

* Add anchor mark-to-base and mark-to-mark positioning for Unicode
  combining mark characters,  to provide positioning for arbitrary
  diacritic marks

UPDATES TO MATH FONT

* Added lowercase chancery script set to correspond to new default
  uppercase script style (U+1D4B6..1D4CF, U+212F, U+U+210A, U+2134).
  Mapped existing roundhand glyphs to Stylistic Set 1 (ss01).

* Added bold chancery script characters (U+1D4D0..U+1D503), also
  activated by Stylistic Set 1 (ss01).

* Refined/replaced existing roundhand script style variant glyphs,
  presuming that these may be preferred by some users to the new
  chancery default.

* Extended set of 'ssty' super- and subscript scaling variants.

* Restored STIX 1 Italic Double Struck mathematical alphabet (PUA
  U+E154..E17B, U+E1B4..E1BB).

* Restored STIX 1 Greek Sans Serif Italic mathematical alphabet (PUA
  U+E1BE..E1F5).

* Completed U+2300..U+23FF Unicode Miscellaneous Technical by adding

-----------------------------------

18 June 2019, STIX Two, version 2.0.2

This release fixes a glitch in the OS/2 tables: Bit 8 (WWS) of the
fsSelection field has been set and the OS/2 table version has been
updated to 4.  No changes were made to any glyphs or metrics.

-----------------------------------

15 April 2019, STIX Two, version 2.0.1

COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN 2.0.1 AND 2.0.0

There have been numerous improvements to the design of individual
glyphs and to the placement of various accents.  Since these don't
affect character metrics, they should not affect the layout of
documents that used v2.0.0 of the fonts.

Users upgrading existing documents from 2.0.0 to 2.0.1 should be aware
of the following potential incompatibilities:

* Character metrics for some glyphs, especially Mathematical
  Alphanumeric Symbols and APL functional symbols, have changed.

* Kerning between z and following punctuation has been improved.

* In STIX2Math, Stylistic Set 7 (ss07) no longer includes U+2205

* U+2202 PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL and U+1D6DB MATHEMATICAL BOLD PARTIAL
  DIFFERENTIAL are now upright by default.

See below for further details.

TEXT FONTS

* Added U+2423 OPEN BOX to all faces.

* Added Stylistic Set ss02 to select upright parentheses, brackets,
  and braces in Italic and BoldItalic faces.

* Harmonized design of smallcap U+02A9 LATIN SMALL LETTER FENG DIGRAPH
  between Regular and Bold faces.

* Improved design of extended Latin and IPA character glyphs.

* Improved kerning of selected character pairs.

* Improved design and placement of U+0307 COMBINING DOT ABOVE and
  U+0308 COMBINING DIAERESIS.

MATH FONTS

* The following Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols have been improved.
  Note that in some case this has necessitated changes to the
  character metrics.

      U+1D504..1D537 Fraktur symbols
      U+1D538..1D56B Double-struck symbols
      U+1D56C..1D59F Bold Fraktur symbols
      U+1D5A0..1D5D3 Sans-serif symbols             [SSP]
      U+1D5D4..1D607 Sans-serif bold symbols        [SSP]
      U+1D608..1D63B Sans-serif italic symbols      [SSP]
      U+1D63C..1D66F Sans-serif bold italic symbols [SSP]
      U+1D670..1D6A3 Monospace symbols
      U+1D756..1D78F Sans-serif bold Greek
      U+1D790..1D7C9 Sans-serif bold italic Greek
      U+1D7D8..1D7E1 Double-struck digits
      U+1D7E2..1D7EB Sans-serif digits              [SSP]
      U+1D7EC..1D7F5 Sans-serif bold digits         [SSP]
      U+1D7F6..1D7FF Monospace digits

  Note: The ranges marked "[SSP]" are derived from the Source Sans Pro
  fonts, with proportions and weight modified to harmonize with the
  STIX design.

* Added support for Unicode Standard Mathematical Standardized Variants.

* Removed variant form of U+2205 EMPTY SET from Stylistic Set 7 to
  Character Variant 3.  NOTE: For most users, the "variant" form will
  be the preferred shape, but the default shape has been left as-is
  for backwards compatibility.

* Improved proportions of existing APL symbols and added an additional
  16 symbols (see below).

* Corrected glyph for U+1D752 MATHEMATICAL BOLD ITALIC KAPPA SYMBOL.

* Improved positioning of tilde math accent.

* Added dotless variants of U+2148 DOUBLE-STRUCK ITALIC SMALL I and
  U_2149 DOUBLE-STRUCK ITALIC SMALL J.

* Made U+2202 PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL and U+1D6DB MATHEMATICAL BOLD
  PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL upright rather than italic.

* Revised and extended coverage of Enclosed Alphanumeric block
  (U+2460-24FF).

* U+20E1 COMBINING LEFT RIGHT ARROW ABOVE is now extensible.

* Corrected vertical placement of U+00B1 PLUS-MINUS SIGN

* The following delimiters now have a full set of 12 growing form
  variants.

        the LaTeX unicode-math package.  There are no plans to include
        further support for Arabic typesetting.


1 December 2016, STIX Two, version 2.0.0

In addition to the overall visual redesign, STIX Two incorporates a
number of significant improvements and additions over version 1 of the
fonts.  Special attention has been given to implementing accepted best
practices for OpenType fonts, such as the use of font features to
access variant glyph shapes that were previously only available via
the Unicode Private Use Areas.

The letterspacing and kerning of the text fonts have been
significantly improved.

True small capital variants (Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek), accessible
via the OpenType font feature smcp, have been added for all text
fonts.

Text (lowercase or oldstyle) numerals, available via the font features
pnum and onum, have been added, in addition to natural-spacing
figures.

Alphabetic superscripts and numeric sub- and superscripts, accessible
via the subs and sups font features, have been added.

Fractions are available via the frac feature, as well as numerators
(numr) and denominators (dnom).

The OpenType MATH table has been completely rewritten and extended.

Additions have been made to these Unicode blocks:
    Latin-1 Supplement          U+0080 - U+00FF
    Latin Extended-A            U+0100 - U+017F
    Latin Extended Additional   U+0180 - U+024F
    Cyrillic                    U+0400 - U+04FF
    Greek and Coptic            U+0370 - U+03FF
    IPA blocks                  U+0250 - U+02AF

BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY

Because of the scope of the changes, especially to the text fonts,
STIX Two is not a drop-in replacement for earlier versions.  While we
understand and sympathize with the difficulties caused by the
incompatibilities we have introduced, we nevertheless felt they were
necessary to address some of the shortcomings of earlier versions of
the fonts and to position us to respond to the needs of modern
publishing.

Earlier versions of the STIX fonts are deprecated and no longer
supported.  We urge all users of the STIX fonts to upgrade to the new
versions as soon as possible.

To enable the new and old versions of the fonts to coexist during the
transition phase, the fonts have been renamed as follows:

    STIX 1.1.0              STIX 2.0.0

    STIX-Regular            STIX Two Text
    STIX-Italic             STIX Two Text Italic
    STIX-Bold               STIX Two Text Bold
    STIX-BoldItalic         STIX Two Text Bold Italic

    STIX Math Regular       STIX Two Math

The four text fonts contain glyphs from Unicode text blocks only.  For
example, all characters from the range U+2190 to U+3063 and U+E000 to
U+E368 and all plane 1 characters have been removed from the text
fonts and are now found only in STIX Two Math.  Whenever possible,
characters have been removed from the Private Use Area (U+E000-U+F8FF)
and made available via font features instead.

The STIX-General packaging of the fonts is no longer supported.

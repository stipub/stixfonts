                            Version 2.0.0

                           1 December 2016

INTRODUCTION

The Scientific and Technical Information eXchange (STIX) fonts are
intended to satisfy the demanding needs of authors, publishers,
printers, and others working in the scientific, medical, and technical
fields.  They combine a comprehensive Unicode-based collection of
mathematical symbols and alphabets with a set of text faces suitable
for professional publishing.  The fonts are available royalty-free
under the SIL Open Font License.

Version 2.0.0 of the STIX fonts, now known as "STIX Two", is a
thorough revision undertaken by the renowned type house Tiro
Typeworks.  The STIX Two fonts consist of four text fonts (Regular,
Italic, Bold, and Bold Italic) and one Math font.  Together, they
provide a uniform set of fonts that can be used throughout the
production process, whether that be a traditional print-only process,
an entirely electronic one, or a combination of the two.

The STIX project began through the joint efforts of American
Mathematical Society (AMS), American Institute of Physics (AIP),
American Physical Society (APS), American Chemical Society (ACS),
Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), and Elsevier.
These companies are collectively known as the STI Pub companies.

A FRESH TAKE ON TIMES ROMAN

The original version of STIX was based on Times Roman, which has now
been updated for the digital age.

As is well known, Times Roman was originally intended for printing the
London Times.  What is not generally appreciated is the fact that the
Times was a very atypically produced newspaper: It was printed on very
high quality paper run through presses that operated more slowly than
most newspaper presses.  This allowed for the design of a typeface
that could benefit from this level of printing: serifs could be very
fine (much finer than other newspaper typefaces) and small counters
(enclosed areas) such as in the lowercase e could be much smaller than
in other newspaper typefaces.  Another anomaly is that the bold font
for Times Roman is, in many respects, strikingly dissimilar to the
roman font.

Tiro Typeworks explain their approach to updating the Times Roman
basis of STIX as follows:

    "Our principal goal in approaching STIX Two was to address several
    inherent deficiencies in the Times New Roman model as well as
    expand the typographic features.  This process necessarily
    involved diverging somewhat from Times, given that many features
    of that typeface are either incompatible with current printing
    methods and electronic reading environments, and some others too
    esoteric to repeat.  That said, the essential 'Times-ness'
    remains, we believe, and such changes won't distract readers and
    users in any negative way.

    "At the core of Times' problems was inappropriate digitization,
    using an optical size model too large to be scaled down to text
    sizes, with compensations appropriate to its original purpose and
    printing technique, but not for 21st century conditions.  We have
    also re-thought somewhat overall proportions and spacing, with
    changes made in varying degrees to both the Roman and the Italic
    (and we have begun to harmonize the Bold, which has always been a
    major shortcoming with Times New Roman)."

WHAT IS NEW IN THIS RELEASE?

In addition to the overall visual redesign, STIX Two incorporates a
number of significant improvements and additions.  Special attention
has been given to implementing accepted best practices for OpenType
fonts, such as the use of font features to access variant glyph shapes
that were previously only available via the Unicode Private Use Areas.

The letterspacing and kerning of the text fonts have been
significantly improved.

True small capital variants (Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek), accessible
via the OpenType font feature smcp, have been added for all text
fonts.

Text (lowercase or oldstyle) numerals, available via the font features
pnum and onum, have been added, in addition to natural-spacing
figures.

Alphabetic superscripts and numeric sub- and superscripts, accessible
via the subs and sups font features, have been added.

Fractions are available via the frac feature, as well as numerators
(numr) and denominators (dnom).

The OpenType MATH table has been completely rewritten and extended.

Additions have been made to these Unicode blocks:
    Latin-1 Supplement          U+0080 - U+00FF
    Latin Extended-A            U+0100 - U+017F
    Latin Extended Additional   U+0180 - U+024F
    Cyrillic                    U+0400 - U+04FF
    Greek and Coptic            U+0370 - U+03FF
    IPA blocks                  U+0250 - U+02AF

Full details of included glyphs and supported font features are
available in the included spreadsheet.

BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY

Because of the scope of the changes, especially to the text fonts,
STIX Two is not a drop-in replacement for earlier versions.  While we
understand and sympathize with the difficulties caused by the
incompatibilities we have introduced, we nevertheless felt they were
necessary to address some of the shortcomings of earlier versions of
the fonts and to position us to respond to the needs of modern
publishing.

Earlier versions of the STIX fonts are deprecated and no longer
supported.  We urge all users of the STIX fonts to upgrade to the new
versions as soon as possible.

To enable the new and old versions of the fonts to coexist during the
transition phase, the fonts have been renamed as follows:

    STIX 1.1.0              STIX 2.0.0

    STIX-Regular            STIX Two Text
    STIX-Italic             STIX Two Text Italic
    STIX-Bold               STIX Two Text Bold
    STIX-BoldItalic         STIX Two Text Bold Italic

    STIX Math Regular       STIX Two Math 

The four text fonts contain glyphs from Unicode text blocks only.  For
example, all characters from the range U+2190 to U+3063 and U+E000 to
U+E368 and all plane 1 characters have been removed from the text
fonts and are now found only in STIX Two Math.  Whenever possible,
characters have been removed from the Private Use Area (U+E000-U+F8FF)
and made available via font features instead.

The STIX-General packaging of the fonts is no longer supported.

The font is distributed under the "SIL Open Font License, Version
1.1", a copy of which is included in the License folder.

Support for 8-bit, DVI-based TeX in the form of TFM files and Type 1
fonts is not yet available.

We also hope to provide a version of the WOFF fonts broken down into
smaller, more web-download-friendly chunks.

FONT IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS

The STIX fonts do not contain fixed-width or sans serif text faces.

The sans serif, fraktur, script, etc., alphabets in Plane 1
(U+1D400-U+1D4FF) are intended to be used only as technical symbols.

These fonts are designed to support left-to-right typesetting in
Latin-based scripts, with additional support for Greek and Cyrillic
text.  Extensions to support other writing directions have been
considered, but are currently deemed to be outside the scope of the
STIX project.

The font contains:

1. Kerning pairs for characters suitable for use with sizes 8pt
   through 12pt.

2. Standard ligature support for those ligatures included in the font.

NOTE TO TEX USERS

As mentioned above, there is no support for DVI-based TeX at present.
However, the fonts have been tested with both XeTeX and luaTeX with
good results.  For best results, XeTeX users will want to upgrade to
the latest development version from

    http://xetex.sourceforge.net/

This version fixes a number of bugs that are present in the version
shipped with TeX Live 2016.  Our thanks go out to Jonathan Kew and
Khaled Hosny for their generous help in identifying and fixing these
bugs.  LaTeX users should also make sure they have the latest version
of the amsmath package available on CTAN.

There are some known issues with kerning of second-order subscripts
that we hope to address in a future release.

FEEDBACK

Please direct any questions or general comments to the STIX Fonts
project.  Bug reports and technical support issues should be reported
